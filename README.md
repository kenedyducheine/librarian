### Librarian
Book recommendation system based on books I like! 
#### Considerations 
1. I joined goodreads jan 2023 so my 'read' column does not contain enough books for training. Used all bookshelves (read + want to read) as train data
2. The api package I bought allows me to run 5000 isbn13 numbers a day... the nyt csv has >60k books.
