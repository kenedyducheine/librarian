He then sets out to prove his theory by murdering a vile, cynical old pawnbroker and her sister. The act brings Raskolnikov into contact with his own buried conscience and with two characters the deeply religious Sonia, who has endured great suffering, and Porfiry, the intelligent and discerning official who is charged with investigating the murder both of whom compel Raskolnikov to feel the split in his nature. Dostoevsky provides readers with a suspenseful, penetrating psychological analysis that goes beyond the crime which in the course of the novel demands drastic punishment to reveal something about the human condition: The more we intellectualize, the more imprisoned we become.</p>',\n",

So at the age of twelve, Burroughs found himself amidst Victorian squalor living with the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s bizarre family, and befriending a pedophile who resided in the backyard shed.

              "       'Our \"thirty-is-the-new-twenty\" culture tells us the twentysomething years don\\'t matter. Some say they are a second adolescence. Others call them an emerging adulthood. Dr. Meg Jay, a clinical psychologist, argues that twentysomethings have been caught in a swirl of hype and misinformation, much of which has trivialized what is actually the most defining decade of adulthood.\\n<p>Drawing from a decade of work with hundreds of twentysomething clients and students, <strong>THE DEFINING DECADE</strong> weaves the latest science of the twentysomething years with behind-closed-doors stories from twentysomethings themselves.

              "       '<p><P>&#8220;The end was near.&#8221; &#8212;Voices from the Zombie War<P>The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. <i>World War Z</i> is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.<P>Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. <P>Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, &#8220;By excluding the human factor, aren&#8217;t we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn&#8217;t the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as &#8216;the living dead&#8217;?&#8221;<P>Note&#58; Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.<P>Eyewitness reports from the first truly global war<P>&#8220;I found &#8216;Patient Zero&#8217; behind the locked door of an abandoned apartment across town. . . . His wrists and feet were bound with plastic packing twine. Although he&#8217;d rubbed off the skin around his bonds, there was no blood. There was also no blood on his other wounds. . . . He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his growls. At first the villagers tried to hold me back. They warned me not to touch him, that he was &#8216;cursed.&#8217; I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves. The boy&#8217;s skin was . . . cold and gray . . . I could find neither his heartbeat nor his pulse.&#8221; &#8212;Dr. Kwang Jingshu, Greater Chongqing, United Federation of China<P>&#8220;&#8216;Shock and Awe&#8217;? Perfect name. . . . But what if the enemy can&#8217;t be shocked and awed? Not just won&#8217;t, but biologically can&#8217;t! That&#8217;s what happened that day outside New York City, that&#8217;s the failure that almost lost us the whole damn war. The fact that we couldn&#8217;t shock and awe Zack boomeranged right back in our faces and actually allowed Zack to shock and awe us! They&#8217;re not afraid! No matter what we do, no matter how many we kill, they will never, ever be afraid!&#8221; &#8212;Todd Wainio, former U.S. Army infantryman and veteran of the Battle of Yonkers<P>&#8220;Two hundred million zombies. Who can even visualize that type of number, let alone combat it? . . . For the first time in history, we faced an enemy that was actively waging total war. They had no limits of endurance. They would never negotiate, never surrender. They would fight until the very end because, unlike us, every single one of them, every second of every day, was devoted to consuming all life on Earth.&#8221; &#8212;General Travis D&#8217;Ambrosia, Supreme Allied Commander, Europe</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In the wake of the great zombie war, Brooks\\'s fictional alter ego travels around the world to ask tough questions of individuals and leaders about their experience and actions before, during and after the undead menace decimated the human population. Brooks remarkably identifies and articulates the nuances and unconsidered realities of what a zombie war would look like. This intriguing \"oral history\" stands apart from his previous zombie-related book, The Zombie Survival Guide, as Brooks uses the postwar culture here to provide political and social commentary on a wide range of real-life individuals and institutions. An all-star cast including Alan Alda, Mark Hamill, J rgen Prochnow, Henry Rollins, John Turturro, Rob and Carl Reiner, and many others deliver their parts with such fervor and intensity that listeners cannot help but empathize with these characters. Max Brooks acts as the interviewer, providing an inquisitive but stagnant demeanor. The abridgment keeps the story tight but struggles with the interviewer\\'s narration during interviews. When Brooks interrupts characters to indicate that the person rolled his eyes or appeared apprehensive, his comments are often moot because the performers are already portraying such body language with their tone.

              "       \"<p><P>In this eloquent and persuasive book, Neil Postman examines the deep and broad effects of television culture on the manner in which we conduct our public affairs, on how entertainment values have corrupted the very way we think. As politics, news, religion, education, and commerce are given expression less and less in the form of printed or spoken words, they are rapidly being reshaped and staged to suit the requirements of television. And because television is a visual medium, whose images are most pleasurably apprehended when they are fast-moving and dynamic, discourse on television takes the form of entertainment. Television has little tolerance for argument, hypothesis, or explanation it demands performing art.<P>Mr. Postman argues that public discourse, the advancing of arguments in logical order for the public good-once the hallmark of American culture-is being converted from exposition and explanation to entertainment.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>From the author of Teaching as a Subversive Activity comes a sustained, withering and thought-provoking attack on television and what it is doing to us. Postman's theme is the decline of the printed word and the ascendancy of the ``tube'' with its tendency to present everythingmurder, mayhem, politics, weatheras entertainment. The ultimate effect, as Postman sees it, is the shrivelling of public discourse as TV degrades our conception of what constitutes news, political debate, art, even religious thought. Early chapters trace America's one-time love affair with the printed word, from colonial pamphlets to the publication of the Lincoln-Douglas debates. There's a biting analysis of TV commercials as a form of ``instant therapy'' based on the assumption that human problems are easily solvable.

In so doing, she illuminates with great sensitivity and intelligence the elusive emotional wellsprings of the creative process.</p><h3>The New Yorker</h3><p>\"She is either Muse or she is nothing,\" Robert Graves wrote. After the Renaissance, the Greek goddesses of artistic inspiration were replaced by real -- if idealized -- women (think Dante and Beatrice). In these well-researched essays, Prose examines the lives of nine women who inspired some of history\\'s most prominent artists and writers, including Samuel Johnson, Man Ray, and John Lennon. Nearly all these muse-artist relationships were distinguished by tragedy, and only five were sexually consummated; as Prose notes, \"The power of longing is more durable than the thrill of possession.\" What emerges by the end of the book, oddly, is a case for the singularity of artistic influence: the author shows that Lewis Carroll\\'s attachment to Alice Liddell was not at all like Nietzsche\\'s sense of intellectual kinship with Lou Andreas-Salom&eacute;<span class=\"bold\">,</span> nor was Yoko Ono\\'s involvement with John Lennon as fruitful as Suzanne Farrell\\'s with George Balanchine. The strongest essays here, on Liddell, Farrell, Ono, and Lee Miller (a <I>Vogue</I> model and photographer who posed for and worked with Man Ray), pointedly refute the notion that the role of the muse is a passive one, and offer in its place a complicated vision of the necessary contradictions of artistic life -- including the desire for both feverish devotion and artistic independence, and a sense of the truth of beauty and the transience of it. Prose\\'s broader conclusions about culture can seem hasty, but the book\\'s achievement is its quiet re&euml;valuation of the received notion that genius is solitary in nature.</p>',\n",

In a Gothic cliffside manor being used as a clinic for sleep disorders, they discover that neither love, nor lunacy, nor obsession ever rests.</p><h3>Charles Taylor</h3><p><P>Befitting a book whose title carries with it a suggestion of dreams, Jonathan Coe\\'s <i>The House of Sleep</i> has a mysteriousness that even its resolution -- in which it becomes clear that every moment has been preparation for all the moments that follow -- cannot dissipate. The setting is an English coastal manor. The chapters alternate between 1983, when the place is a university residence, and 1996, when it has become a clinic for the study of sleep disorders. The same characters exist in both periods, first as students, then, later, as patients and doctors, or in other more complicated permutations. Sleep, its abundance and absence, weaves its way through the novel as both subject and metaphor. Sarah is a narcoleptic rone to dreams she can\\'t later distinguish from reality. Terry is a film critic who has replaced the need for sleep (and thus dreams) with movies. For the head of the clinic, Dr. Dudden, sleep is a disease to be eradicated. <P>Coe calls to mind the high silliness of Wodehouse farces and also Waugh\\'s crueler social satire. But as with his last novel, the savage and majestic <i>The Winshaw Legacy</i>, it\\'s Dickens I thought of most often. The bloody satirical extremes that Coe sometimes goes to have nothing of Dickens\\' transcendent sentimentality, and there is a sense in which literature for Coe is gamesmanship. What brings Dickens to mind is that Coe, a wonderful storyteller, thinks of novels in terms of grand schemes where everything -- chance meetings, the sudden reappearance of fondly remembered objects -- finally all fit together. The most casual human exchanges become freighted with significance, the always-present possibility that, in throwaway moments, we completely reveal what sort of people we are. <P>For all the metaliterary touches Coe indulges in (touches that aim always to entertain), he\\'s motivated primarily by rage and compassion. Margaret Thatcher and her legacy have provided him with as great a subject as the workhouses and orphanages did Dickens, first in <i>The Winshaw Legacy</i>, and now in <i>The House of Sleep</i>. Coe is writing about a society suffering the aftereffects of an experiment intended to separate poor from rich, weak from strong, conducted for the simple pleasure of being able to exert such power. In <i>The House of Sleep</i>, Dr. Dudden is a pissant Thatcher, conducting his experiments to prove that sleep, like any other uman need, is a weakness denoting those who need it -- those who need anything -- as losers in the law of natural selection. <P><i>The House of Sleep</i> is full of people who have embraced Dudden\\'s world, rejected it or are unexpectedly beginning to reject it. There\\'s a special poignancy in a London banker describing her lover\\'s suicide in these terms: \"She finds a nice long cul-de-sac with a brick wall at the end, revs up to ninety miles an hour, and drives straight into it. Writes off the company BMW. Writes herself off into the bargain.\" The offhand beauty of those lines comes from the emotion the language cannot express, the mournful bitterness of the speaker as she realizes that a human being cannot be written off as a deduction. Fittingly, Coe\\'s aesthetic response to his subject -- a world ruled by the ethic of weaken, divide, conquer -- is to speak in language that, while far from common, is completely accessible. Coe has an almost 19th century faith in the ability of a novel to immerse you in a created world that resonates in the actual world at every turn. His motto here might be \"To dream, perchance to awaken.\" -- <i>Salon</i></p>',\n",

              "       'In an unorthodox approach, Georgetown University professor Cal Newport debunks the long-held belief that \"follow your passion\" is good advice, and sets out on a quest to discover the reality of how people end up loving their careers. Not only are pre-existing passions rare and have little to do with how most people end up loving their work, but a focus on passion over skill can be dangerous, leading to anxiety and chronic job hopping. Spending time with organic farmers, venture capitalists, screenwriters, freelance computer programmers, and others who admitted to deriving great satisfaction from their work, Newport uncovers the strategies they used and the pitfalls they avoided in developing their compelling careers. Cal reveals that matching your job to a pre-existing passion does not matter. Passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something valuable, not before. In other words, what you do for a living is much less important than how you do it. With a title taken from the comedian Steve Martin, who once said his advice for aspiring entertainers was to \"be so good they can\\'t ignore you,\" Cal Newport\\'s clearly written manifesto is mandatory reading for anyone fretting about what to do with their life, or frustrated by their current job situation and eager to find a fresh new way to take control of their livelihood. He provides an evidence-based blueprint for creating work you love, and will change the way you think about careers, happiness, and the crafting of a remarkable life.',\n",
