7,THE PIONEER WOMAN COOKS,"['Drummond, Ree']",9780061658198,"<blockquote>
<p>My name is Ree.</p>
<p>Some folks know me as The Pioneer Woman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After years of living in Los Angeles, I made a pit stop in my hometown in Oklahoma on the way to a new, exciting life in Chicago. It was during my stay at home that I met Marlboro Man, a mysterious cowboy with steely blue eyes and a muscular, work-honed body. A strict vegetarian, I fell hard and fast, and before I knew it we were married and living on his ranch in the middle of nowhere, taking care of animals, and managing a brood of four young children. I had no idea how I'd wound up there, but I knew it was exactly where I belonged.</p>
<p><b>The Pioneer Woman Cooks</b> is a homespun collection of photography, rural stories, and scrumptious recipes that have defined my experience in the country. I share many of the delicious cowboy-tested recipes I've learned to make during my years as an accidental ranch wife—including Rib-Eye Steak with Whiskey Cream Sauce, Lasagna, Fried Chicken, Patsy's Blackberry Cobbler, and Cinnamon Rolls—not to mention several ""cowgirl-friendly"" dishes, such as Sherried Tomato Soup, Olive Cheese Bread, and Crème Brûlée. I show my recipes in full color, step-by-step detail, so it's as easy as pie to follow along.</p>
<p>You'll also find colorful images of rural life: cows, horses, country kids, and plenty of chaps-wearing cowboys.</p>
<p>I hope you get a kick out of this book of mine. I hope it makes you smile. I hope the recipes bring you recognition, accolades, and marriage proposals. And I hope it encourages even the most harried urban cook to slow down, relish the joys of family, nature, and great food, and enjoy life.</p>"

She won back-to-back Country Music Awards as Female Vocalist of the Year in 1997 and 1998 and has been honored with three Grammy Awards. In 2005, Trisha married superstar Garth Brooks, and they currently reside in Oklahoma.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p><P>Grammy Award-winning country singer Trisha Yearwood throws her hat into the celebrity cookbook ring with this cheerful if uninspired collection of home-style Southern recipes. Among family and friends, Yearwood is known for her cooking, she writes, and a foreword by her husband and fellow singer, Garth Brooks, explains that Yearwood's secret is that she cooks with love, a technique not fully explored in this book. Aimed at the kitchen beginner, the book presents a list of necessary equipment and hints on substitutions, like making confectioner's sugar from granulated sugar, and is sprinkled throughout with helpful notes from Yearwood and her mother and sister-both of whom are co-writers. International stardom clearly hasn't dampened Yearwood's enthusiasm for down-home treats like Pimento Cheese Spread, Hashbrown Casserole, and Cranberry Salad with Cool Whip, Cream Cheese and Gelatin. Her family members make frequent appearances in the many color photographs and in the form of favorite dishes like Jack's Brunswick Stew and Gwen's Fried Chicken with Milk Gravy. Yearwood is an advocate for no-fuss, simple cooking with plenty of supermarket shortcuts, and this volume will most appeal to fans who want to get a little closer to Yearwood and Brooks (like a chance to recreate the celebs' wedding cake at home). <I>(Apr.)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information</p>"

15,THE BOOK OF GENESIS: ILLUSTRATED,"['Crumb, R.']",9780393061024,"Envisioning the first book of the bible like no one before him, R. Crumb, the legendary illustrator, reveals here the story of Genesis in a profoundly honest and deeply moving way. Originally thinking that we would do a take off of Adam and Eve, Crumb became so fascinated by the Bible’s language, “a text so great and so strange that it lends itself readily to graphic depictions,” that he decided instead to do a literal interpretation using the text word for word in a version primarily assembled from the translations of Robert Alter and the King James bible.
<p>Now, readers of every persuasion—Crumb fans, comic book lovers, and believers—can gain astonishing new insights from these harrowing, tragic, and even juicy stories. Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em> reintroduces us to the bountiful tree lined garden of Adam and Eve, the massive ark of Noah with beasts of every kind, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed by brimstone and fire that rained from the heavens, and the Egypt of the Pharaoh, where Joseph’s embalmed body is carried in a coffin, in a scene as elegiac as any in Genesis. Using clues from the text and peeling away the theological and scholarly interpretation that have often obscured the Bible’s most dramatic stories, Crumb fleshes out a parade of Biblical originals: from the serpent in Eden, the humanoid reptile appearing like an alien out of a science fiction movie, to Jacob, a “kind’ve depressed guy who doesn’t strike you as physically courageous,” and his bother, Esau, “a rough and kick ass guy,” to Abraham’s wife Sarah, more fetching than most woman at 90, to God himself, “a standard Charlton Heston-like figure with long white hair and a flowing beard.”</p>
<p>As Crumb writes in his introduction, “the stories of these people, the Hebrews, were something more than just stories. They were the foundation, the source, in writing of religious and political power, handed down by God himself.” Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em>, the culmination of 5 years of painstaking work, is a tapestry of masterly detail and storytelling which celebrates the astonishing diversity of the one of our greatest artistic geniuses.</p>

Tailored from the adored Jane Austen classic, Marvel Comics is proud to present Pride & Prejudice! Two-time Rita Award-Winner Nancy Butler and fan-favorite Hugo Petras faithfully adapt the whimsical tale of Lizzy Bennet and her loveable-if-eccentric family, as they navigate through tricky British social circles. Will Lizzy's father manage to marry off her five daughters, despite his wife's incessant nagging? And will Lizzy's beautiful sister Jane marry the handsome, wealthy Mr. Bingley, or will his brooding friend Mr. Darcy stand between their happiness?<p>Collects Pride & Prejudice #1-5.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that the United States is not Japan, and certainly this is no multivolume manga. We don't savor at length Lizzie's inner monologs or hover along through the Regency social dailiness that contextualizes Austen's comedy of matrimony. To be fair, the basic plot is pretty much here, bonsaied down from Austen's 400-plus pages. And Butler does quite a good job at keeping the continuity while letting each major character have a chance in the spotlight. But Austen's women don't come off well&mdash;they all have a similar superhero female character from central casting look, seeming even to wear lipstick. The muddy coloring doesn't help either, with too many browns and ochres slathered together to scream, IN THE PAST. (We shouldn't blame Petrus, a capable Spanish artist who perhaps received misleading direction.) VERDICT This P&P packages Austen's classic for fanboys and newbies. Women readers and Austenites are likely to want more story, more appealing art, and more distinctive female characters. For teens and up.&mdash;M.C.</p>"

21,HAVE A LITTLE FAITH,"['Albom, Mitch']",9780786868728,"<p>What if our beliefs were not what divided us, but what pulled us together?<p> In <i>Have a Little Faith</i>, Mitch Albom offers a beautifully written story of a remarkable eight year journey between two worlds - two men, two faiths, two communities - that will inspire readers everywhere. <p> Albom's first nonfiction book since <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> was published twelve years ago, <i>Have A Little Faith</i> begins with an unusual request: an 82-year-old rabbi from Albom's old hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy. <p> Feeling unworthy, Albom insists on understanding the man better, which throws him back into a world of faith he'd left years ago. Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor - a reformed drug dealer and convict - who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. <p> Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Mitch observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi, embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat. <p> As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Mitch and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers and histories are different, Albom begins to realize a striking unity between the two worlds - and indeed, between beliefs everywhere. <p> In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself. <p> <i>Have a Little Faith</i> is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Starred Review. <P>Albom delivers a command audio performance. He brings his two clergymen-protagonists-an elderly rabbi from Albom's home synagogue and an African-American pastor leading a ministry to Detroit's homeless population-to vivid life and conveys their messages of faith with sensitivity and respect. The audio's most memorable moments feature the humility-and eccentricity-of the two spiritual leaders who, despite their deep religious commitment, refuse to be placed on a pedestal. From the ail-ing Jewish leader breaking out into whimsical songs in the middle of his grueling medical treatments and his Christian counterpart savoring the joys of barbecuing, Albom's characterizations brim with humor and compassion.

Dangerously ill when he finished his climb in 1993, Mortenson was sheltered for seven weeks by the small Pakistani village of Korphe; in return, he promised to build the impoverished town's first school, a project that grew into the Central Asia Institute, which has since constructed more than 50 schools across rural Pakistan and Afghanistan.

52,GLENN BECK’S ‘COMMON SENSE’,"['Beck, Glenn']",9781439168578,"<p>In any era, great Americans inspire us to reach our full potential. They know with conviction what they believe within themselves. They understand that all actions have consequences. And they find commonsense solutions to the nation’s problems. <i>?</i></p>
<p>One such American, Thomas Paine, was an ordinary man who changed the course of history by penning Common Sense, the concise 1776 masterpiece in which, through extraordinarily straightforward and indisputable arguments, he encouraged his fellow citizens to take control of America’s future—and, ultimately, her freedom.</p>
<p>Nearly two and a half centuries later, those very freedoms once again hang in the balance. And now, Glenn Beck revisits Paine’s powerful treatise with one purpose: to galvanize Americans to see past government’s easy solutions, two-party monopoly, and illogical methods and take back our great country.</p>"

57,NUBS,"['Dennis, Major Brian', 'Nethery, Mary', 'Larson, Kirby']",9780316053181,"<p><P>Nubs, an Iraqi dog of war, never had a home or a person of his own. He was the leader of a pack of wild dogs living off the land and barely surviving. But Nubs's life changed when he met Marine Major Brian Dennis. The two formed a fast friendship, made stronger by Dennis's willingness to share his meals, offer a warm place to sleep, and give Nubs the kind of care and attention he had never received before. Nubs became part of Dennis's human pack until duty required the Marines to relocate a full 70 miles away&#151;without him. Nubs had no way of knowing that Marines were not allowed to have pets.<P>So began an incredible journey that would take Nubs through a freezing desert, filled with danger tofind his friend and would lead Dennis on a mission that would touch the hearts of people all over the world. <P>Nubs and Dennis will remind readers that friendship has the power to cross deserts, continents, and even species.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Larson and Nethery, who collaborated on Two Bobbies, team up with Dennis to tell the moving story of the Marine major&rsquo;s friendship with a wild dog he befriended at a border fort in Iraq. Dennis named the dog Nubs because his &ldquo;ears had been cut off to make him a dog of war&rdquo; (a statement never explained). Though Nubs futilely attempts to follow Dennis when he departs the fort, the two grow closer on subsequent visits, until the dog (now wounded) treks 70 miles through the snow to find Dennis. When the major is ordered to &ldquo;get rid of the dog, or else,&rdquo; he raises money to have Nubs transported to his San Diego hometown, where human and dog eventually reunite. Some spreads feel cluttered with narrative passages, e-mail sidebars, and multiple images; the photographs, gleaned from several sources, are of varying quality and resolution (understandable given the circumstances under which most were taken). But these do not diminish the emotional impact of the saga, which should appeal to fans of Owen and Mzee and other stories of animals that triumph against the odds. Ages 3&ndash;up. (Nov.)</p>"
58,WADDLE!,"['Butler Seder, Rufus']",9780761151128,"<p>It's <i>Waddle!</i> And it's in color. And boy, is it irresistible. In the same way that kids can't read <i>Gallop!</i> without wanting to gallop around the room, <i>Waddle!</i>, an animals-in-motion Scanimation book, will inspire prancing, hopping, stomping, and scampering. And did we mention color? Created by the optical genius behind the phenomenal #1 and #2 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling children's books, <i>Gallop!</i> and <i>Swing!</i>, <i>Waddle!</i> adds touches of color to the images and integrates it into the text. That prancing pig is pink, the leaping dolphin is blue, the slithering snake yellow. The Scanimation itself is also more lifelike, as the author continues to refine his patented Scanimation process, resulting in a more fluid, realistic motion. Nothing else compares. <p><i>Waddle!</i> teaches color and movement. Its language is a joy, the rhymes inspiring, the animals full of life. And one more thing&#58; Waddle! has a surprise ending. Something else to grab the reader&mdash;literally.<br></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>On the heels of Gallop! and Swing!, Seder's latest Scanimation ode to movement adds color to its bestselling formula, mostly to good effect. Like the previous books, the simple text poses playful questions (&ldquo;Can you hop like a frog? flip-flop-floop!&rdquo;). The level of detail on a few animals (the hopping frog, leaping dolphin and chomping alligator) is striking, but the addition of color also has the effect of reducing the contrast, and thus the detail, in others (notably the pig, hummingbird and bear), whose features are indistinct. Still, readers should find the animations mesmerizing. Ages 4&ndash;8. (Oct.)\</p>"

It was during my stay at home that I met Marlboro Man, a mysterious cowboy with steely blue eyes and a muscular, work-honed body. A strict vegetarian, I fell hard and fast, and before I knew it we were married and living on his ranch in the middle of nowhere, taking care of animals, and managing a brood of four young children.

I share many of the delicious cowboy-tested recipes I've learned to make during my years as an accidental ranch wife—including Rib-Eye Steak with Whiskey Cream Sauce, Lasagna, Fried Chicken, Patsy's Blackberry Cobbler, and Cinnamon Rolls—not to mention several ""cowgirl-friendly"" dishes, such as Sherried Tomato Soup, Olive Cheese Bread, and Crème Brûlée. I show my recipes in full color, step-by-step detail, so it's as easy as pie to follow along.</p>
<p>You'll also find colorful images of rural life: cows, horses, country kids, and plenty of chaps-wearing cowboys.</p>
<p>I hope you get a kick out of this book of mine. I hope it makes you smile. I hope the recipes bring you recognition, accolades, and marriage proposals. And I hope it encourages even the most harried urban cook to slow down, relish the joys of family, nature, and great food, and enjoy life.</p>"

84,THE BOOK OF GENESIS: ILLUSTRATED,"['Crumb, R.']",9780393061024,"Envisioning the first book of the bible like no one before him, R. Crumb, the legendary illustrator, reveals here the story of Genesis in a profoundly honest and deeply moving way. Originally thinking that we would do a take off of Adam and Eve, Crumb became so fascinated by the Bible’s language, “a text so great and so strange that it lends itself readily to graphic depictions,” that he decided instead to do a literal interpretation using the text word for word in a version primarily assembled from the translations of Robert Alter and the King James bible.
<p>Now, readers of every persuasion—Crumb fans, comic book lovers, and believers—can gain astonishing new insights from these harrowing, tragic, and even juicy stories. Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em> reintroduces us to the bountiful tree lined garden of Adam and Eve, the massive ark of Noah with beasts of every kind, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed by brimstone and fire that rained from the heavens, and the Egypt of the Pharaoh, where Joseph’s embalmed body is carried in a coffin, in a scene as elegiac as any in Genesis. Using clues from the text and peeling away the theological and scholarly interpretation that have often obscured the Bible’s most dramatic stories, Crumb fleshes out a parade of Biblical originals: from the serpent in Eden, the humanoid reptile appearing like an alien out of a science fiction movie, to Jacob, a “kind’ve depressed guy who doesn’t strike you as physically courageous,” and his bother, Esau, “a rough and kick ass guy,” to Abraham’s wife Sarah, more fetching than most woman at 90, to God himself, “a standard Charlton Heston-like figure with long white hair and a flowing beard.”</p>
<p>As Crumb writes in his introduction, “the stories of these people, the Hebrews, were something more than just stories. They were the foundation, the source, in writing of religious and political power, handed down by God himself.” Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em>, the culmination of 5 years of painstaking work, is a tapestry of masterly detail and storytelling which celebrates the astonishing diversity of the one of our greatest artistic geniuses.</p>

</b> <br>
Meet Asterios Polyp: middle-aged, meagerly successful architect and teacher, aesthete and womanizer, whose life is wholly upended when his New York City apartment goes up in flames. In a tenacious daze, he leaves the city and relocates to a small town in the American heartland. But what is this “escape” really about? 
<p>As the story unfolds, moving between the present and the past, we begin to understand this confounding yet fascinating character, and how he’s gotten to where he is. And isn’t. And we meet Hana: a sweet, smart, first-generation Japanese American artist with whom he had made a blissful life. But now she’s gone. Did Asterios do something to drive her away? What has happened to her? Is she even alive? All the questions will be answered, eventually.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we are enthralled by Mazzucchelli’s extraordinarily imagined world of brilliantly conceived eccentrics, sharply observed social mores, and deftly depicted asides on everything from design theory to the nature of human perception.<br>

Tailored from the adored Jane Austen classic, Marvel Comics is proud to present Pride & Prejudice! Two-time Rita Award-Winner Nancy Butler and fan-favorite Hugo Petras faithfully adapt the whimsical tale of Lizzy Bennet and her loveable-if-eccentric family, as they navigate through tricky British social circles. Will Lizzy's father manage to marry off her five daughters, despite his wife's incessant nagging? And will Lizzy's beautiful sister Jane marry the handsome, wealthy Mr. Bingley, or will his brooding friend Mr. Darcy stand between their happiness?<p>Collects Pride & Prejudice #1-5.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that the United States is not Japan, and certainly this is no multivolume manga. We don't savor at length Lizzie's inner monologs or hover along through the Regency social dailiness that contextualizes Austen's comedy of matrimony. To be fair, the basic plot is pretty much here, bonsaied down from Austen's 400-plus pages. And Butler does quite a good job at keeping the continuity while letting each major character have a chance in the spotlight. But Austen's women don't come off well&mdash;they all have a similar superhero female character from central casting look, seeming even to wear lipstick. The muddy coloring doesn't help either, with too many browns and ochres slathered together to scream, IN THE PAST. (We shouldn't blame Petrus, a capable Spanish artist who perhaps received misleading direction.) VERDICT This P&P packages Austen's classic for fanboys and newbies. Women readers and Austenites are likely to want more story, more appealing art, and more distinctive female characters. For teens and up.&mdash;M.C.</p>"

Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor - a reformed drug dealer and convict - who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. <p> Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Mitch observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi, embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat. <p> As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Mitch and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers and histories are different, Albom begins to realize a striking unity between the two worlds - and indeed, between beliefs everywhere. <p> In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself. <p> <i>Have a Little Faith</i> is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Starred Review. <P>Albom delivers a command audio performance. He brings his two clergymen-protagonists-an elderly rabbi from Albom's home synagogue and an African-American pastor leading a ministry to Detroit's homeless population-to vivid life and conveys their messages of faith with sensitivity and respect. The audio's most memorable moments feature the humility-and eccentricity-of the two spiritual leaders who, despite their deep religious commitment, refuse to be placed on a pedestal. From the ail-ing Jewish leader breaking out into whimsical songs in the middle of his grueling medical treatments and his Christian counterpart savoring the joys of barbecuing, Albom's characterizations brim with humor and compassion.

Their only real clue might just be a mysterious silvery mineral traced to a long-ago expedition in search of the fabled Northwest Passage. But no one survived from that doomed mission, captain and crew perished to a man&#151;and if Pitt and his colleague Al Giordino aren't careful, the very same fate may await them.<p>Filled with the breathtaking suspense and audacious imagination that have become his hallmarks, this is a tour de force&#151; further proof that when it comes to adventure writing, nobody beats Clive Cussler.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Bestseller Cussler and son Dirk imagine the U.S. and Canada on the brink of war in their third collaborative Dirk Pitt novel (after <I>Treasure of Khan</I> and <I>Black Wind</I>). In 2011, as the price of gas hits $10 a gallon, President Garner Ward must contend with a corrupt Canadian cabal that's subverting efforts to solve America's energy problems. Pitt barely escapes serious injury when a bomb destroys a D.C. lab along with records of research into an artificial photosynthesis process that could, almost immediately, eliminate the threat of global warming. That discovery may be connected with a legendary failed 19th-century sailing expedition to the Arctic as well as a series of deaths due to the phenomena that the Native Americans of British Columbia know as ""the Devil's Breath.""

Dangerously ill when he finished his climb in 1993, Mortenson was sheltered for seven weeks by the small Pakistani village of Korphe; in return, he promised to build the impoverished town's first school, a project that grew into the Central Asia Institute, which has since constructed more than 50 schools across rural Pakistan and Afghanistan. Coauthor Relin recounts Mortenson's efforts in fascinating detail, presenting compelling portraits of the village elders, con artists, philanthropists, mujahideen, Taliban officials, ambitious school girls and upright Muslims Mortenson met along the way. As the book moves into the post-9/11 world, Mortenson and Relin argue that the United States must fight Islamic extremism in the region through collaborative efforts to alleviate poverty and improve access to education, especially for girls. Captivating and suspenseful, with engrossing accounts of both hostilities and unlikely friendships, this book will win many readers' hearts. (Mar.) Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.</p>"

<p>This exceptional graphic novel recounts the spiritual odyssey of philosopher Bertrand Russell. In his agonized search for absolute truth, Russell crosses paths with legendary thinkers like Gottlob Frege, David Hilbert, and Kurt Gödel, and finds a passionate student in the great Ludwig Wittgenstein. But his most ambitious goal—to establish unshakable logical foundations of mathematics—continues to loom before him. Through love and hate, peace and war, Russell persists in the dogged mission that threatens to claim both his career and his personal happiness, finally driving him to the brink of insanity.</p>
<p>This story is at the same time a historical novel and an accessible explication of some of the biggest ideas of mathematics and modern philosophy. With rich characterizations and expressive, atmospheric artwork, the book spins the pursuit of these ideas into a highly satisfying tale.</p>
<p>Probing and ingeniously layered, the book throws light on Russell’s inner struggles while setting them in the context of the timeless questions he spent his life trying to answer. At its heart, <i>Logicomix</i> is a story about the conflict between an ideal rationality and the unchanging, flawed fabric of reality.</p>"

128,WADDLE!,"['Butler Seder, Rufus']",9780761151128,"<p>It's <i>Waddle!</i> And it's in color. And boy, is it irresistible. In the same way that kids can't read <i>Gallop!</i> without wanting to gallop around the room, <i>Waddle!</i>, an animals-in-motion Scanimation book, will inspire prancing, hopping, stomping, and scampering. And did we mention color? Created by the optical genius behind the phenomenal #1 and #2 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling children's books, <i>Gallop!</i> and <i>Swing!</i>, <i>Waddle!</i> adds touches of color to the images and integrates it into the text. That prancing pig is pink, the leaping dolphin is blue, the slithering snake yellow. The Scanimation itself is also more lifelike, as the author continues to refine his patented Scanimation process, resulting in a more fluid, realistic motion. Nothing else compares. <p><i>Waddle!</i> teaches color and movement. Its language is a joy, the rhymes inspiring, the animals full of life. And one more thing&#58; Waddle! has a surprise ending. Something else to grab the reader&mdash;literally.<br></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>On the heels of Gallop! and Swing!, Seder's latest Scanimation ode to movement adds color to its bestselling formula, mostly to good effect. Like the previous books, the simple text poses playful questions (&ldquo;Can you hop like a frog? flip-flop-floop!&rdquo;). The level of detail on a few animals (the hopping frog, leaping dolphin and chomping alligator) is striking, but the addition of color also has the effect of reducing the contrast, and thus the detail, in others (notably the pig, hummingbird and bear), whose features are indistinct. Still, readers should find the animations mesmerizing. Ages 4&ndash;8. (Oct.)\</p>"

As Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge, Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger. In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob &#151;- knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella has one more decision to make&#58; life or death. But which is which?</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>The legions of readers who are hooked on the romantic struggles of Bella and the vampire Edward will ecstatically devour this third installment of the story begun in <I>Twilight, </I>but it's unlikely to win over any newcomers. Jake, the werewolf met in <I>New Moon</I>, pursues Bella with renewed vigilance. However, when repercussions from an episode in <I>Twilight</I>place Bella in the mortal danger that series fans have come to expect, Jake and Edward forge an uneasy alliance. The plot patterns have begun to show here, but Meyer's other strengths remain intact. The supernatural elements accentuate the ordinary human dramas of growing up. Jake and Edward's competition for Bella feels particularly authentic, especially in their apparent desire to best each other as much as to win Bella. Once again the author presents teenage love as an almost inhuman force: ""[He] would have been my soul mate still,"" says Bella, ""if his claim had not been overshadowed by something stronger, something so strong that it could not exist in a rational world."" According to Meyer, the fourth book should tie up at least the Edward story, if not the whole shebang. Ages 12-up<I>. (Aug.)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information</p>"

148,THE PIONEER WOMAN COOKS,"['Drummond, Ree']",9780061658198,"<blockquote>
<p>My name is Ree.</p>
<p>Some folks know me as The Pioneer Woman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After years of living in Los Angeles, I made a pit stop in my hometown in Oklahoma on the way to a new, exciting life in Chicago. It was during my stay at home that I met Marlboro Man, a mysterious cowboy with steely blue eyes and a muscular, work-honed body. A strict vegetarian, I fell hard and fast, and before I knew it we were married and living on his ranch in the middle of nowhere, taking care of animals, and managing a brood of four young children. I had no idea how I'd wound up there, but I knew it was exactly where I belonged.</p>
<p><b>The Pioneer Woman Cooks</b> is a homespun collection of photography, rural stories, and scrumptious recipes that have defined my experience in the country. I share many of the delicious cowboy-tested recipes I've learned to make during my years as an accidental ranch wife—including Rib-Eye Steak with Whiskey Cream Sauce, Lasagna, Fried Chicken, Patsy's Blackberry Cobbler, and Cinnamon Rolls—not to mention several ""cowgirl-friendly"" dishes, such as Sherried Tomato Soup, Olive Cheese Bread, and Crème Brûlée. I show my recipes in full color, step-by-step detail, so it's as easy as pie to follow along.</p>
<p>You'll also find colorful images of rural life: cows, horses, country kids, and plenty of chaps-wearing cowboys.</p>
<p>I hope you get a kick out of this book of mine. I hope it makes you smile. I hope the recipes bring you recognition, accolades, and marriage proposals. And I hope it encourages even the most harried urban cook to slow down, relish the joys of family, nature, and great food, and enjoy life.</p>"

154,THE BOOK OF GENESIS: ILLUSTRATED,"['Crumb, R.']",9780393061024,"Envisioning the first book of the bible like no one before him, R. Crumb, the legendary illustrator, reveals here the story of Genesis in a profoundly honest and deeply moving way. Originally thinking that we would do a take off of Adam and Eve, Crumb became so fascinated by the Bible’s language, “a text so great and so strange that it lends itself readily to graphic depictions,” that he decided instead to do a literal interpretation using the text word for word in a version primarily assembled from the translations of Robert Alter and the King James bible.
<p>Now, readers of every persuasion—Crumb fans, comic book lovers, and believers—can gain astonishing new insights from these harrowing, tragic, and even juicy stories. Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em> reintroduces us to the bountiful tree lined garden of Adam and Eve, the massive ark of Noah with beasts of every kind, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed by brimstone and fire that rained from the heavens, and the Egypt of the Pharaoh, where Joseph’s embalmed body is carried in a coffin, in a scene as elegiac as any in Genesis. Using clues from the text and peeling away the theological and scholarly interpretation that have often obscured the Bible’s most dramatic stories, Crumb fleshes out a parade of Biblical originals: from the serpent in Eden, the humanoid reptile appearing like an alien out of a science fiction movie, to Jacob, a “kind’ve depressed guy who doesn’t strike you as physically courageous,” and his bother, Esau, “a rough and kick ass guy,” to Abraham’s wife Sarah, more fetching than most woman at 90, to God himself, “a standard Charlton Heston-like figure with long white hair and a flowing beard.”</p>
<p>As Crumb writes in his introduction, “the stories of these people, the Hebrews, were something more than just stories. They were the foundation, the source, in writing of religious and political power, handed down by God himself.” Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em>, the culmination of 5 years of painstaking work, is a tapestry of masterly detail and storytelling which celebrates the astonishing diversity of the one of our greatest artistic geniuses.</p>

159,HAVE A LITTLE FAITH,"['Albom, Mitch']",9780786868728,"<p>What if our beliefs were not what divided us, but what pulled us together?<p> In <i>Have a Little Faith</i>, Mitch Albom offers a beautifully written story of a remarkable eight year journey between two worlds - two men, two faiths, two communities - that will inspire readers everywhere. <p> Albom's first nonfiction book since <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> was published twelve years ago, <i>Have A Little Faith</i> begins with an unusual request: an 82-year-old rabbi from Albom's old hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy. <p> Feeling unworthy, Albom insists on understanding the man better, which throws him back into a world of faith he'd left years ago. Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor - a reformed drug dealer and convict - who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. <p> Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Mitch observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi, embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat. <p> As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Mitch and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers and histories are different, Albom begins to realize a striking unity between the two worlds - and indeed, between beliefs everywhere. <p> In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself. <p> <i>Have a Little Faith</i> is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Starred Review. <P>Albom delivers a command audio performance. He brings his two clergymen-protagonists-an elderly rabbi from Albom's home synagogue and an African-American pastor leading a ministry to Detroit's homeless population-to vivid life and conveys their messages of faith with sensitivity and respect. The audio's most memorable moments feature the humility-and eccentricity-of the two spiritual leaders who, despite their deep religious commitment, refuse to be placed on a pedestal. From the ail-ing Jewish leader breaking out into whimsical songs in the middle of his grueling medical treatments and his Christian counterpart savoring the joys of barbecuing, Albom's characterizations brim with humor and compassion.

But it is as mayor of his hometown &#151; Natchez, Mississippi &#151; that Penn will face his most dangerous threat. Urged by old friends to try to restore this fading jewel of the Old South, Penn has ridden into office on a tide of support for change. But in its quest for new jobs and fresh money, Natchez, like other Mississippi towns, has turned to casino gambling, and now five fantastical steamboats float on the river beside the old slave market at Natchez like props from <i>Gone With the Wind</i>. <P> But one boat isn't like the others. <P> Rumor has it that the Magnolia Queen has found a way to pull the big players from Las Vegas to its Mississippi backwater. And with them &#151; on sleek private jets that slip in and out of town like whispers in the night &#151; come pro football players, rap stars, and international gamblers, all sharing an unquenchable taste for one thing&#58; blood sport &#151; and the dark vices that go with it. When a childhood friend of Penn's who brings him evidence of these crimes is brutally murdered, the full weight of Penn's failure to protect his city hits home. So begins his quest to find the men responsible. But it's a hunt he begins alone, for the local authorities have been corrupted by the money and power of his hidden enemy. With his family's lives at stake, Penn realizes his only allies in his one-man war are those bound to him by blood or honor&#58; <blockquote> <li>Caitlin Masters, the lover Penn found in <i>The Quiet Can Game</i> and lost in <i>Turning Angel</i></li> <li>Danny McDavitt, the heroic helicopter pilot from <i>Third Degree</i></li> <li>Tom Cage, Penn's father and legendary local family physician</li> <li>Walt Garrity, a retired Texas Ranger who served with Penn's father during the Korean War</li> </blockquote> <P> Together they must defeat a sophisticated killer who has an almost preternatural ability to anticipate &#151; and counter &#151; their every move. Ultimately, victory will depend on a bold stroke that will leave one of Penn's allies dead &#151; and Natchez changed forever. <P> After appearing in two of Iles's most popular novels, Penn Cage makes his triumphant return as a brilliant, honorable, and courageous hero. Rich with Southern atmosphere and marked by one jaw-dropping plot turn after another, <i>The Devil's Punchbowl</i> confirms that Greg Iles is America's master of suspense.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Iles's third addition to the Penn Cage saga is an effective thriller that would have been even more satisfying at half its length. There is a lot of story to cover, with Cage now mayor of Natchez, Miss., battling to save his hometown, his family and his true love from the evil clutches of a pair of homicidal casino operators who are being protected by a homeland security bigwig. Dick Hill handles the large cast of characters effortlessly, adopting Southern accents that range from aristocratic (Cage and his elderly father) to redneck (assorted Natchez townsfolk). He provides the bad guys with their vocal flair, including an icy arrogance for the homeland security honcho, a soft Asian-tempered English for the daughter of an international villain and the rough Irish brogue of the two main antagonists. One of the latter pretends to be an upper-class Englishman and, in a moment of revelation, Hill does a smashing job of switching accents mid-sentence. A Scribner hardcover (Reviews, May 25).

A luxurious house, fancy private school, a new wardrobe, the promise of college and a future&#151;it's a dream come true. So why is Ruby such a reluctant Cinderella, wary and defensive?

After her mother abandons her, Ruby Cooper is flying below the radar of officialdom and trying to make it to her 18th birthday, when she s busted by the landlord and turned over to social services. Ruby gets taken in by her estranged sister, Cora, who left for college a decade earlier and never looked back, and Cora s husband, Jamie, the wealthy founder of a ubiquitous social networking site. Resentful, suspicious and vulnerable, she resists mightily, refusing the risky business of depending on anybody but herself, and wearing the key to her old house around her neck. All the Dessen trademarks are here the swoon-worthy boy next door who is not what he appears to be; and the supporting characters who force Ruby to rethink her cynical worldview, among them the frazzled owner of a jewelry kiosk at the mall. The author again defines characters primarily through dialogue, and although Ruby and her love interest, Nate, sound wiser than their years, they talk the way teens might want to from the heart.

184,LOGICOMIX - AN EPIC SEARCH FOR TRUTH,"['Doxiadis, Apostolos', 'Papadimitriou, Christos']",9781596914520,"<p class=""null1"">An innovative, dramatic graphic novel about the treacherous pursuit of the foundations of mathematics.</p>
<p>This exceptional graphic novel recounts the spiritual odyssey of philosopher Bertrand Russell. In his agonized search for absolute truth, Russell crosses paths with legendary thinkers like Gottlob Frege, David Hilbert, and Kurt Gödel, and finds a passionate student in the great Ludwig Wittgenstein. But his most ambitious goal—to establish unshakable logical foundations of mathematics—continues to loom before him. Through love and hate, peace and war, Russell persists in the dogged mission that threatens to claim both his career and his personal happiness, finally driving him to the brink of insanity.</p>
<p>This story is at the same time a historical novel and an accessible explication of some of the biggest ideas of mathematics and modern philosophy. With rich characterizations and expressive, atmospheric artwork, the book spins the pursuit of these ideas into a highly satisfying tale.</p>
<p>Probing and ingeniously layered, the book throws light on Russell’s inner struggles while setting them in the context of the timeless questions he spent his life trying to answer. At its heart, <i>Logicomix</i> is a story about the conflict between an ideal rationality and the unchanging, flawed fabric of reality.</p>"

In this volume, the bizarrely childlike time-traveling team member Number Five recruits his siblings to right a wrong&mdash;to save President Kennedy before he is assassinated, possibly saving the world in the bargain.

But which is which?</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>The legions of readers who are hooked on the romantic struggles of Bella and the vampire Edward will ecstatically devour this third installment of the story begun in <I>Twilight, </I>but it's unlikely to win over any newcomers. Jake, the werewolf met in <I>New Moon</I>, pursues Bella with renewed vigilance. However, when repercussions from an episode in <I>Twilight</I>place Bella in the mortal danger that series fans have come to expect, Jake and Edward forge an uneasy alliance. The plot patterns have begun to show here, but Meyer's other strengths remain intact. The supernatural elements accentuate the ordinary human dramas of growing up. Jake and Edward's competition for Bella feels particularly authentic, especially in their apparent desire to best each other as much as to win Bella. Once again the author presents teenage love as an almost inhuman force: ""[He] would have been my soul mate still,"" says Bella, ""if his claim had not been overshadowed by something stronger, something so strong that it could not exist in a rational world."" According to Meyer, the fourth book should tie up at least the Edward story, if not the whole shebang. Ages 12-up<I>. (Aug.)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information</p>"

The only sticking point is that Roman tricked Ever just as she saved Damen's life and now they are never allowed to touch. All of this occurred at the end of Evermore (St. Martin's, 2009), and these events are quickly recounted here. However, readers not familiar with that book will still find this one confusing. Ever is understandably upset at the idea of eternal life with her beloved while never allowed to kiss (not to mention anything else), and Damen is determined to find a reversal spell. Then things get even stickier for these romantic heroes. Ever runs into Jude, the man she's married or almost married in her past incarnations. Is she supposed to end up with him instead of Damen? And Damen becomes responsible for twins who escaped the fires of Salem but are now homeless and still aged 13. Can he overturn his bad karma by becoming father to these homeless girls? While Ever is a rather na&iuml;ve and superficial protagonist, she still manages to hold readers' interest more than she annoys. Additionally, the question of love versus destiny is one that many romantic fantasy readers enjoy pondering. This is a quick read for fans of the first book who are looking for light romance with some magic added for good measure.&mdash;Saleena L.

216,YOU: THE OWNER’S MANUAL FOR TEENS,"['Roizen, Michael F.', 'Oz, Mehmet']",9781439164969,"<p>For the first time in our history, scientists are uncovering astounding medical evidence about dieting — and why so many of us struggle with our weight and the size of our waists. Now researchers are unraveling biological secrets about such things as why you crave chocolate or gorge at buffets or store so much fat.</p>
<p>Michael Roizen and Mehmet Oz, America's most trusted doctor team and authors of the bestselling <i>YOU</i> series, are now translating this cutting-edge information to help you shave inches off your waist. They're going to do it by giving you the best weapon against fat: knowledge. By understanding how your body's fat-storing and fat-burning systems work, you're going to learn how to crack the code on true and lifelong waist management.</p>
<p>Roizen and Oz will invigorate you with equal parts information, motivation, and change-your-life action to show you how your brain, stomach, hormones, muscles, heart, genetics, and stress levels all interact biologically to determine if your body is the size of a baseball bat or of a baseball stadium. In <i>YOU: On a Diet</i>, Roizen and Oz will redefine what a healthy figure is, then take you through an under-theskin tour of the organs that influence your body's size and its health. You'll even be convinced that the key number to fixate on is not your weight, but your waist size, which best indicates the medical risks of storing too much fat.</p>
<p>Because the world has almost as many diet plans as it has e-mail spammers, you'd think that just about all of us would know everything there is to know about dieting, about fat, and about the reasons why our bellies have grown so large. <i>YOU: On a Diet</i> is much more than a diet plan or a series of instructions and guidelines or a faddish berries-only eating plan. It's a complete manual for waist management. It will show you how to achieve and maintain an ideal and healthy body size by providing a lexicon according to which any weight-loss system can be explained. <i>YOU: On a Diet</i> will serve as the operating system that facilitates future evolution in our dieting software. After you learn about the biology of your body and the biology and psychology of fat, you'll be given the YOU Diet and YOU Workout. Both are easy to learn, follow, and maintain. Following a two-week rebooting program will help you lose up to two inches from your waist right from the start.</p>
<p>With Roizen and Oz's signature accessibility, wit, and humor, <i>YOU: On a Diet — The Owner's Manual for Waist Management</i> will revolutionize the way you think about yourself and the food you consume, so that you'll diet smart, not hard. Welcome to your body on a diet.</p>"

224,THE BOOK OF GENESIS: ILLUSTRATED,"['Crumb, R.']",9780393061024,"Envisioning the first book of the bible like no one before him, R. Crumb, the legendary illustrator, reveals here the story of Genesis in a profoundly honest and deeply moving way. Originally thinking that we would do a take off of Adam and Eve, Crumb became so fascinated by the Bible’s language, “a text so great and so strange that it lends itself readily to graphic depictions,” that he decided instead to do a literal interpretation using the text word for word in a version primarily assembled from the translations of Robert Alter and the King James bible.
<p>Now, readers of every persuasion—Crumb fans, comic book lovers, and believers—can gain astonishing new insights from these harrowing, tragic, and even juicy stories. Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em> reintroduces us to the bountiful tree lined garden of Adam and Eve, the massive ark of Noah with beasts of every kind, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed by brimstone and fire that rained from the heavens, and the Egypt of the Pharaoh, where Joseph’s embalmed body is carried in a coffin, in a scene as elegiac as any in Genesis. Using clues from the text and peeling away the theological and scholarly interpretation that have often obscured the Bible’s most dramatic stories, Crumb fleshes out a parade of Biblical originals: from the serpent in Eden, the humanoid reptile appearing like an alien out of a science fiction movie, to Jacob, a “kind’ve depressed guy who doesn’t strike you as physically courageous,” and his bother, Esau, “a rough and kick ass guy,” to Abraham’s wife Sarah, more fetching than most woman at 90, to God himself, “a standard Charlton Heston-like figure with long white hair and a flowing beard.”</p>
<p>As Crumb writes in his introduction, “the stories of these people, the Hebrews, were something more than just stories. They were the foundation, the source, in writing of religious and political power, handed down by God himself.” Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em>, the culmination of 5 years of painstaking work, is a tapestry of masterly detail and storytelling which celebrates the astonishing diversity of the one of our greatest artistic geniuses.</p>

Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor - a reformed drug dealer and convict - who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. <p> Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Mitch observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi, embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat. <p> As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Mitch and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers and histories are different, Albom begins to realize a striking unity between the two worlds - and indeed, between beliefs everywhere. <p> In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself. <p> <i>Have a Little Faith</i> is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Starred Review. <P>Albom delivers a command audio performance. He brings his two clergymen-protagonists-an elderly rabbi from Albom's home synagogue and an African-American pastor leading a ministry to Detroit's homeless population-to vivid life and conveys their messages of faith with sensitivity and respect. The audio's most memorable moments feature the humility-and eccentricity-of the two spiritual leaders who, despite their deep religious commitment, refuse to be placed on a pedestal. From the ail-ing Jewish leader breaking out into whimsical songs in the middle of his grueling medical treatments and his Christian counterpart savoring the joys of barbecuing, Albom's characterizations brim with humor and compassion.

239,THE DEVIL’S PUNCHBOWL,"['Iles, Greg']",9781416524557,"<p><P>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Greg Iles comes his most electrifying thriller yet. <i>The Devil's Punchbowl</i> reveals a world of depravity, sex, violence, and the corruption of a Southern town. <P> As a prosecuting attorney in Houston, Penn Cage sent hardened killers to death row. But it is as mayor of his hometown &#151; Natchez, Mississippi &#151; that Penn will face his most dangerous threat. Urged by old friends to try to restore this fading jewel of the Old South, Penn has ridden into office on a tide of support for change. But in its quest for new jobs and fresh money, Natchez, like other Mississippi towns, has turned to casino gambling, and now five fantastical steamboats float on the river beside the old slave market at Natchez like props from <i>Gone With the Wind</i>. <P> But one boat isn't like the others. <P> Rumor has it that the Magnolia Queen has found a way to pull the big players from Las Vegas to its Mississippi backwater. And with them &#151; on sleek private jets that slip in and out of town like whispers in the night &#151; come pro football players, rap stars, and international gamblers, all sharing an unquenchable taste for one thing&#58; blood sport &#151; and the dark vices that go with it. When a childhood friend of Penn's who brings him evidence of these crimes is brutally murdered, the full weight of Penn's failure to protect his city hits home. So begins his quest to find the men responsible. But it's a hunt he begins alone, for the local authorities have been corrupted by the money and power of his hidden enemy. With his family's lives at stake, Penn realizes his only allies in his one-man war are those bound to him by blood or honor&#58; <blockquote> <li>Caitlin Masters, the lover Penn found in <i>The Quiet Can Game</i> and lost in <i>Turning Angel</i></li> <li>Danny McDavitt, the heroic helicopter pilot from <i>Third Degree</i></li> <li>Tom Cage, Penn's father and legendary local family physician</li> <li>Walt Garrity, a retired Texas Ranger who served with Penn's father during the Korean War</li> </blockquote> <P> Together they must defeat a sophisticated killer who has an almost preternatural ability to anticipate &#151; and counter &#151; their every move. Ultimately, victory will depend on a bold stroke that will leave one of Penn's allies dead &#151; and Natchez changed forever. <P> After appearing in two of Iles's most popular novels, Penn Cage makes his triumphant return as a brilliant, honorable, and courageous hero. Rich with Southern atmosphere and marked by one jaw-dropping plot turn after another, <i>The Devil's Punchbowl</i> confirms that Greg Iles is America's master of suspense.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Iles's third addition to the Penn Cage saga is an effective thriller that would have been even more satisfying at half its length. There is a lot of story to cover, with Cage now mayor of Natchez, Miss., battling to save his hometown, his family and his true love from the evil clutches of a pair of homicidal casino operators who are being protected by a homeland security bigwig. Dick Hill handles the large cast of characters effortlessly, adopting Southern accents that range from aristocratic (Cage and his elderly father) to redneck (assorted Natchez townsfolk). He provides the bad guys with their vocal flair, including an icy arrogance for the homeland security honcho, a soft Asian-tempered English for the daughter of an international villain and the rough Irish brogue of the two main antagonists. One of the latter pretends to be an upper-class Englishman and, in a moment of revelation, Hill does a smashing job of switching accents mid-sentence. A Scribner hardcover (Reviews, May 25).

As eerie as this might seem, there are things in the Barrens that are even more frightening and dangerous. And there are monkeys. Lots of monkeys. Wulf Grimoire is a world wanderer and an opportunist who can kill without remorse and disappear like smoke.

Dangerously ill when he finished his climb in 1993, Mortenson was sheltered for seven weeks by the small Pakistani village of Korphe; in return, he promised to build the impoverished town's first school, a project that grew into the Central Asia Institute, which has since constructed more than 50 schools across rural Pakistan and Afghanistan. Coauthor Relin recounts Mortenson's efforts in fascinating detail, presenting compelling portraits of the village elders, con artists, philanthropists, mujahideen, Taliban officials, ambitious school girls and upright Muslims Mortenson met along the way. As the book moves into the post-9/11 world, Mortenson and Relin argue that the United States must fight Islamic extremism in the region through collaborative efforts to alleviate poverty and improve access to education, especially for girls. Captivating and suspenseful, with engrossing accounts of both hostilities and unlikely friendships, this book will win many readers' hearts. (Mar.) Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.</p>"

The level of detail on a few animals (the hopping frog, leaping dolphin and chomping alligator) is striking, but the addition of color also has the effect of reducing the contrast, and thus the detail, in others (notably the pig, hummingbird and bear), whose features are indistinct.

Now, in the wake of Araluen's uneasy truce with the raiding Skandians comes word that the Skandian leader has been captured by a dangerous desert tribe. The Rangers are sent to free him. But the desert is like nothing these warriors have seen before. Strangers in a strange land, they are brutalized by sandstorms, beaten by the unrelenting heat, tricked by one tribe that plays by its own rules, and surprisingly befriended by another. Like a desert mirage, nothing is as it seems. Yet one thing is constant&#58; the bravery of the Rangers.<P> In this red-hot adventure, winner of the Australian Book of the Year Award for Older Children, John Flanagan raises the stakes on the series that has already sold millions of copies worldwide.</p><h3>VOYA</h3><p>The book 7 and book 8 installments in the popular Ranger's Apprentice series will not disappoint fans. Erak's Ransom, book 7, takes place before the start of book 5, when Will is still an apprentice to Halt. The Skandian leader Erak, an ally of the Araluen's, has been captured and ransomed by a tribe of warriors from the desert. Will's courage and Ranger abilities are tested throughout the difficult quest to find and free Erak. Evanlyn has the chance to prove she is just as brave as the warriors around her as she negotiates Erak's freedom. At the conclusion of book 7, Will graduates as a Ranger and is placed in charge of his own fief. The Will that readers meet again in The Kings of Clonmel, book 8, is now confident and cunning. When a religious cult called the Outsiders conquers several surrounding kingdoms, Will, Halt, and Horace set out to convince the residents of Clonmel to believe in the abilities of the Sunrise Warrior instead of lies being spread by Tennyson, the cult's leader. At the conclusion of this book, the Rangers defeat the evil forces and restore order to the kingdom. As a result of brilliant characterization, the protagonists in books 7 and 8 have the skills to persistently outwit and outfight opponents while still maintaining a sense of humor that makes them seem realistic. True to this series, books 7 and 8 are filled with twists and turns, impassioned negotiations between leaders, and vivid, bloody battles complete with the clang of weapons. Reviewer: Amy Wyckoff</p>"

286,YOU: THE OWNER’S MANUAL FOR TEENS,"['Roizen, Michael F.', 'Oz, Mehmet']",9781439164969,"<p>For the first time in our history, scientists are uncovering astounding medical evidence about dieting — and why so many of us struggle with our weight and the size of our waists. Now researchers are unraveling biological secrets about such things as why you crave chocolate or gorge at buffets or store so much fat.</p>
<p>Michael Roizen and Mehmet Oz, America's most trusted doctor team and authors of the bestselling <i>YOU</i> series, are now translating this cutting-edge information to help you shave inches off your waist. They're going to do it by giving you the best weapon against fat: knowledge. By understanding how your body's fat-storing and fat-burning systems work, you're going to learn how to crack the code on true and lifelong waist management.</p>
<p>Roizen and Oz will invigorate you with equal parts information, motivation, and change-your-life action to show you how your brain, stomach, hormones, muscles, heart, genetics, and stress levels all interact biologically to determine if your body is the size of a baseball bat or of a baseball stadium. In <i>YOU: On a Diet</i>, Roizen and Oz will redefine what a healthy figure is, then take you through an under-theskin tour of the organs that influence your body's size and its health. You'll even be convinced that the key number to fixate on is not your weight, but your waist size, which best indicates the medical risks of storing too much fat.</p>
<p>Because the world has almost as many diet plans as it has e-mail spammers, you'd think that just about all of us would know everything there is to know about dieting, about fat, and about the reasons why our bellies have grown so large. <i>YOU: On a Diet</i> is much more than a diet plan or a series of instructions and guidelines or a faddish berries-only eating plan. It's a complete manual for waist management. It will show you how to achieve and maintain an ideal and healthy body size by providing a lexicon according to which any weight-loss system can be explained. <i>YOU: On a Diet</i> will serve as the operating system that facilitates future evolution in our dieting software. After you learn about the biology of your body and the biology and psychology of fat, you'll be given the YOU Diet and YOU Workout. Both are easy to learn, follow, and maintain. Following a two-week rebooting program will help you lose up to two inches from your waist right from the start.</p>
<p>With Roizen and Oz's signature accessibility, wit, and humor, <i>YOU: On a Diet — The Owner's Manual for Waist Management</i> will revolutionize the way you think about yourself and the food you consume, so that you'll diet smart, not hard. Welcome to your body on a diet.</p>"

294,THE BOOK OF GENESIS: ILLUSTRATED,"['Crumb, R.']",9780393061024,"Envisioning the first book of the bible like no one before him, R. Crumb, the legendary illustrator, reveals here the story of Genesis in a profoundly honest and deeply moving way. Originally thinking that we would do a take off of Adam and Eve, Crumb became so fascinated by the Bible’s language, “a text so great and so strange that it lends itself readily to graphic depictions,” that he decided instead to do a literal interpretation using the text word for word in a version primarily assembled from the translations of Robert Alter and the King James bible.
<p>Now, readers of every persuasion—Crumb fans, comic book lovers, and believers—can gain astonishing new insights from these harrowing, tragic, and even juicy stories. Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em> reintroduces us to the bountiful tree lined garden of Adam and Eve, the massive ark of Noah with beasts of every kind, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed by brimstone and fire that rained from the heavens, and the Egypt of the Pharaoh, where Joseph’s embalmed body is carried in a coffin, in a scene as elegiac as any in Genesis. Using clues from the text and peeling away the theological and scholarly interpretation that have often obscured the Bible’s most dramatic stories, Crumb fleshes out a parade of Biblical originals: from the serpent in Eden, the humanoid reptile appearing like an alien out of a science fiction movie, to Jacob, a “kind’ve depressed guy who doesn’t strike you as physically courageous,” and his bother, Esau, “a rough and kick ass guy,” to Abraham’s wife Sarah, more fetching than most woman at 90, to God himself, “a standard Charlton Heston-like figure with long white hair and a flowing beard.”</p>
<p>As Crumb writes in his introduction, “the stories of these people, the Hebrews, were something more than just stories. They were the foundation, the source, in writing of religious and political power, handed down by God himself.” Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em>, the culmination of 5 years of painstaking work, is a tapestry of masterly detail and storytelling which celebrates the astonishing diversity of the one of our greatest artistic geniuses.</p>

Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor - a reformed drug dealer and convict - who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. <p> Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Mitch observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi, embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat. <p> As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Mitch and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers and histories are different, Albom begins to realize a striking unity between the two worlds - and indeed, between beliefs everywhere. <p> In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself. <p> <i>Have a Little Faith</i> is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Starred Review. <P>Albom delivers a command audio performance. He brings his two clergymen-protagonists-an elderly rabbi from Albom's home synagogue and an African-American pastor leading a ministry to Detroit's homeless population-to vivid life and conveys their messages of faith with sensitivity and respect. The audio's most memorable moments feature the humility-and eccentricity-of the two spiritual leaders who, despite their deep religious commitment, refuse to be placed on a pedestal. From the ail-ing Jewish leader breaking out into whimsical songs in the middle of his grueling medical treatments and his Christian counterpart savoring the joys of barbecuing, Albom's characterizations brim with humor and compassion.

311,THE DEVIL’S PUNCHBOWL,"['Iles, Greg']",9781416524557,"<p><P>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Greg Iles comes his most electrifying thriller yet. <i>The Devil's Punchbowl</i> reveals a world of depravity, sex, violence, and the corruption of a Southern town. <P> As a prosecuting attorney in Houston, Penn Cage sent hardened killers to death row. But it is as mayor of his hometown &#151; Natchez, Mississippi &#151; that Penn will face his most dangerous threat. Urged by old friends to try to restore this fading jewel of the Old South, Penn has ridden into office on a tide of support for change. But in its quest for new jobs and fresh money, Natchez, like other Mississippi towns, has turned to casino gambling, and now five fantastical steamboats float on the river beside the old slave market at Natchez like props from <i>Gone With the Wind</i>. <P> But one boat isn't like the others. <P> Rumor has it that the Magnolia Queen has found a way to pull the big players from Las Vegas to its Mississippi backwater. And with them &#151; on sleek private jets that slip in and out of town like whispers in the night &#151; come pro football players, rap stars, and international gamblers, all sharing an unquenchable taste for one thing&#58; blood sport &#151; and the dark vices that go with it. When a childhood friend of Penn's who brings him evidence of these crimes is brutally murdered, the full weight of Penn's failure to protect his city hits home. So begins his quest to find the men responsible. But it's a hunt he begins alone, for the local authorities have been corrupted by the money and power of his hidden enemy. With his family's lives at stake, Penn realizes his only allies in his one-man war are those bound to him by blood or honor&#58; <blockquote> <li>Caitlin Masters, the lover Penn found in <i>The Quiet Can Game</i> and lost in <i>Turning Angel</i></li> <li>Danny McDavitt, the heroic helicopter pilot from <i>Third Degree</i></li> <li>Tom Cage, Penn's father and legendary local family physician</li> <li>Walt Garrity, a retired Texas Ranger who served with Penn's father during the Korean War</li> </blockquote> <P> Together they must defeat a sophisticated killer who has an almost preternatural ability to anticipate &#151; and counter &#151; their every move. Ultimately, victory will depend on a bold stroke that will leave one of Penn's allies dead &#151; and Natchez changed forever. <P> After appearing in two of Iles's most popular novels, Penn Cage makes his triumphant return as a brilliant, honorable, and courageous hero. Rich with Southern atmosphere and marked by one jaw-dropping plot turn after another, <i>The Devil's Punchbowl</i> confirms that Greg Iles is America's master of suspense.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Iles's third addition to the Penn Cage saga is an effective thriller that would have been even more satisfying at half its length. There is a lot of story to cover, with Cage now mayor of Natchez, Miss., battling to save his hometown, his family and his true love from the evil clutches of a pair of homicidal casino operators who are being protected by a homeland security bigwig. Dick Hill handles the large cast of characters effortlessly, adopting Southern accents that range from aristocratic (Cage and his elderly father) to redneck (assorted Natchez townsfolk). He provides the bad guys with their vocal flair, including an icy arrogance for the homeland security honcho, a soft Asian-tempered English for the daughter of an international villain and the rough Irish brogue of the two main antagonists. One of the latter pretends to be an upper-class Englishman and, in a moment of revelation, Hill does a smashing job of switching accents mid-sentence. A Scribner hardcover (Reviews, May 25).

<p>Turn on all the lights and check under your bed. Things are about to get spooky in Trenton, New Jersey. According to legend, the Jersey Devil prowls the Pine Barrens and soars above the treetops in the dark of night. As eerie as this might seem, there are things in the Barrens that are even more frightening and dangerous. And there are monkeys. Lots of monkeys. Wulf Grimoire is a world wanderer and an opportunist who can kill without remorse and disappear like smoke. He’s chosen Martin Munch, boy genius, as his new business partner, and he’s chosen the Barrens as his new playground. Munch received his doctorate degree in quantum physics when he was twenty-two. He’s now twenty-four, and while his brain is large, his body hasn’t made it out of the boys’ department at Macy’s. Anyone who says good things come in small packages hasn’t met Munch. Wulf Grimoire is looking for world domination. Martin Munch would be happy if he could just get a woman naked and tied to a tree. Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has Munch on her most-wanted list for failure to appear in court. Plum is the all-American girl stuck in an uncomfortable job, succeeding on luck and tenacity. Usually she gets her man. This time she gets a monkey. She also gets a big guy named Diesel. Diesel pops in and out of Plum’s life like birthday cake – delicious to look at and taste, not especially healthy as a steady diet, gone by the end of the week if not sooner. He’s an über bounty hunter with special skills when it comes to tracking men and pleasing women. He’s after Grimoire, and now he’s also after Munch. And if truth were told, he wouldn’t mind setting Stephanie Plum in his crosshairs. Diesel and Plum hunt down Munch and Grimoire, following them into the Barrens, surviving cranberry bogs, the Jersey Devil, a hair-raising experience, sand in their underwear, and, of course . . . monkeys.</p>"

At the heart of the book is ""The Save Yourself Plan"" - a streamlined, five-month countdown that delivers genuine long-term financial security.

321,THREE CUPS OF TEA,"['Greg Mortenson', 'David Oliver Relin']",9780142414125,"<p><P>This young readers' edition of the worldwide bestseller <i>Three Cups of Tea</i> has been specially adapted and updated by Greg Mortenson to bring his remarkable story of humanitarianism up-to-date. It includes brand-new photos, maps, and illustrations, as well as a special afterword by Greg's twelve-year-old daughter, Amira, who has traveled with her father as an advocate for the Pennies for Peace program for children.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Some failures lead to phenomenal successes, and this American nurse's unsuccessful attempt to climb K2, the world's second tallest mountain, is one of them. Dangerously ill when he finished his climb in 1993, Mortenson was sheltered for seven weeks by the small Pakistani village of Korphe; in return, he promised to build the impoverished town's first school, a project that grew into the Central Asia Institute, which has since constructed more than 50 schools across rural Pakistan and Afghanistan. Coauthor Relin recounts Mortenson's efforts in fascinating detail, presenting compelling portraits of the village elders, con artists, philanthropists, mujahideen, Taliban officials, ambitious school girls and upright Muslims Mortenson met along the way. As the book moves into the post-9/11 world, Mortenson and Relin argue that the United States must fight Islamic extremism in the region through collaborative efforts to alleviate poverty and improve access to education, especially for girls. Captivating and suspenseful, with engrossing accounts of both hostilities and unlikely friendships, this book will win many readers' hearts. (Mar.) Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.</p>"

In the same way that kids can't read <i>Gallop!</i> without wanting to gallop around the room, <i>Waddle!</i>, an animals-in-motion Scanimation book, will inspire prancing, hopping, stomping, and scampering. And did we mention color? Created by the optical genius behind the phenomenal #1 and #2 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling children's books, <i>Gallop!</i> and <i>Swing!</i>, <i>Waddle!</i> adds touches of color to the images and integrates it into the text. That prancing pig is pink, the leaping dolphin is blue, the slithering snake yellow. The Scanimation itself is also more lifelike, as the author continues to refine his patented Scanimation process, resulting in a more fluid, realistic motion. Nothing else compares. <p><i>Waddle!</i> teaches color and movement. Its language is a joy, the rhymes inspiring, the animals full of life. And one more thing&#58; Waddle! has a surprise ending. Something else to grab the reader&mdash;literally.<br></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>On the heels of Gallop! and Swing!, Seder's latest Scanimation ode to movement adds color to its bestselling formula, mostly to good effect. Like the previous books, the simple text poses playful questions (&ldquo;Can you hop like a frog? flip-flop-floop!&rdquo;). The level of detail on a few animals (the hopping frog, leaping dolphin and chomping alligator) is striking, but the addition of color also has the effect of reducing the contrast, and thus the detail, in others (notably the pig, hummingbird and bear), whose features are indistinct. Still, readers should find the animations mesmerizing. Ages 4&ndash;8. (Oct.)\</p>"

This action-packed novel continues the saga of warfare for supremacy in Britain, a brutal period when Saxon and Danish swords, battleaxes, and treachery ruled the day. By now, Alfred the Great is old and feeble, unwilling and unable to repel the Danish invaders. He relies on trusty pagan warlord Uhtred, but Uhtred's temper and an unexpected violent act force Uhtred to break his oath of loyalty to Alfred and flee north with his men, intending to reclaim his ancestral home. En route, they face marauding Danish armies, betrayal, battles for a pirate treasure, and the curse of a vicious Danish witch, only to eventually be manipulated back into fighting for Alfred. Vivid descriptions of merciless battlefield slaughter, rape, and destruction are artfully related by a masterful storyteller. Uhtred is victorious in some battles, but the outcome of others will have to wait for the sequel. (Jan.)</p>"

364,THE BOOK OF GENESIS: ILLUSTRATED,"['Crumb, R.']",9780393061024,"Envisioning the first book of the bible like no one before him, R. Crumb, the legendary illustrator, reveals here the story of Genesis in a profoundly honest and deeply moving way. Originally thinking that we would do a take off of Adam and Eve, Crumb became so fascinated by the Bible’s language, “a text so great and so strange that it lends itself readily to graphic depictions,” that he decided instead to do a literal interpretation using the text word for word in a version primarily assembled from the translations of Robert Alter and the King James bible.
<p>Now, readers of every persuasion—Crumb fans, comic book lovers, and believers—can gain astonishing new insights from these harrowing, tragic, and even juicy stories. Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em> reintroduces us to the bountiful tree lined garden of Adam and Eve, the massive ark of Noah with beasts of every kind, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed by brimstone and fire that rained from the heavens, and the Egypt of the Pharaoh, where Joseph’s embalmed body is carried in a coffin, in a scene as elegiac as any in Genesis. Using clues from the text and peeling away the theological and scholarly interpretation that have often obscured the Bible’s most dramatic stories, Crumb fleshes out a parade of Biblical originals: from the serpent in Eden, the humanoid reptile appearing like an alien out of a science fiction movie, to Jacob, a “kind’ve depressed guy who doesn’t strike you as physically courageous,” and his bother, Esau, “a rough and kick ass guy,” to Abraham’s wife Sarah, more fetching than most woman at 90, to God himself, “a standard Charlton Heston-like figure with long white hair and a flowing beard.”</p>
<p>As Crumb writes in his introduction, “the stories of these people, the Hebrews, were something more than just stories. They were the foundation, the source, in writing of religious and political power, handed down by God himself.” Crumb’s <em>Book of Genesis</em>, the culmination of 5 years of painstaking work, is a tapestry of masterly detail and storytelling which celebrates the astonishing diversity of the one of our greatest artistic geniuses.</p>

Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor - a reformed drug dealer and convict - who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. <p> Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Mitch observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi, embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat. <p> As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Mitch and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers and histories are different, Albom begins to realize a striking unity between the two worlds - and indeed, between beliefs everywhere. <p> In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself. <p> <i>Have a Little Faith</i> is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Starred Review. <P>Albom delivers a command audio performance. He brings his two clergymen-protagonists-an elderly rabbi from Albom's home synagogue and an African-American pastor leading a ministry to Detroit's homeless population-to vivid life and conveys their messages of faith with sensitivity and respect. The audio's most memorable moments feature the humility-and eccentricity-of the two spiritual leaders who, despite their deep religious commitment, refuse to be placed on a pedestal. From the ail-ing Jewish leader breaking out into whimsical songs in the middle of his grueling medical treatments and his Christian counterpart savoring the joys of barbecuing, Albom's characterizations brim with humor and compassion.

381,THE DEVIL’S PUNCHBOWL,"['Iles, Greg']",9781416524557,"<p><P>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Greg Iles comes his most electrifying thriller yet. <i>The Devil's Punchbowl</i> reveals a world of depravity, sex, violence, and the corruption of a Southern town. <P> As a prosecuting attorney in Houston, Penn Cage sent hardened killers to death row. But it is as mayor of his hometown &#151; Natchez, Mississippi &#151; that Penn will face his most dangerous threat. Urged by old friends to try to restore this fading jewel of the Old South, Penn has ridden into office on a tide of support for change. But in its quest for new jobs and fresh money, Natchez, like other Mississippi towns, has turned to casino gambling, and now five fantastical steamboats float on the river beside the old slave market at Natchez like props from <i>Gone With the Wind</i>. <P> But one boat isn't like the others. <P> Rumor has it that the Magnolia Queen has found a way to pull the big players from Las Vegas to its Mississippi backwater. And with them &#151; on sleek private jets that slip in and out of town like whispers in the night &#151; come pro football players, rap stars, and international gamblers, all sharing an unquenchable taste for one thing&#58; blood sport &#151; and the dark vices that go with it. When a childhood friend of Penn's who brings him evidence of these crimes is brutally murdered, the full weight of Penn's failure to protect his city hits home. So begins his quest to find the men responsible. But it's a hunt he begins alone, for the local authorities have been corrupted by the money and power of his hidden enemy. With his family's lives at stake, Penn realizes his only allies in his one-man war are those bound to him by blood or honor&#58; <blockquote> <li>Caitlin Masters, the lover Penn found in <i>The Quiet Can Game</i> and lost in <i>Turning Angel</i></li> <li>Danny McDavitt, the heroic helicopter pilot from <i>Third Degree</i></li> <li>Tom Cage, Penn's father and legendary local family physician</li> <li>Walt Garrity, a retired Texas Ranger who served with Penn's father during the Korean War</li> </blockquote> <P> Together they must defeat a sophisticated killer who has an almost preternatural ability to anticipate &#151; and counter &#151; their every move. Ultimately, victory will depend on a bold stroke that will leave one of Penn's allies dead &#151; and Natchez changed forever. <P> After appearing in two of Iles's most popular novels, Penn Cage makes his triumphant return as a brilliant, honorable, and courageous hero. Rich with Southern atmosphere and marked by one jaw-dropping plot turn after another, <i>The Devil's Punchbowl</i> confirms that Greg Iles is America's master of suspense.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Iles's third addition to the Penn Cage saga is an effective thriller that would have been even more satisfying at half its length. There is a lot of story to cover, with Cage now mayor of Natchez, Miss., battling to save his hometown, his family and his true love from the evil clutches of a pair of homicidal casino operators who are being protected by a homeland security bigwig. Dick Hill handles the large cast of characters effortlessly, adopting Southern accents that range from aristocratic (Cage and his elderly father) to redneck (assorted Natchez townsfolk). He provides the bad guys with their vocal flair, including an icy arrogance for the homeland security honcho, a soft Asian-tempered English for the daughter of an international villain and the rough Irish brogue of the two main antagonists. One of the latter pretends to be an upper-class Englishman and, in a moment of revelation, Hill does a smashing job of switching accents mid-sentence. A Scribner hardcover (Reviews, May 25).

<p>Turn on all the lights and check under your bed. Things are about to get spooky in Trenton, New Jersey. According to legend, the Jersey Devil prowls the Pine Barrens and soars above the treetops in the dark of night. As eerie as this might seem, there are things in the Barrens that are even more frightening and dangerous. And there are monkeys. Lots of monkeys. Wulf Grimoire is a world wanderer and an opportunist who can kill without remorse and disappear like smoke. He’s chosen Martin Munch, boy genius, as his new business partner, and he’s chosen the Barrens as his new playground. Munch received his doctorate degree in quantum physics when he was twenty-two. He’s now twenty-four, and while his brain is large, his body hasn’t made it out of the boys’ department at Macy’s. Anyone who says good things come in small packages hasn’t met Munch. Wulf Grimoire is looking for world domination. Martin Munch would be happy if he could just get a woman naked and tied to a tree. Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has Munch on her most-wanted list for failure to appear in court. Plum is the all-American girl stuck in an uncomfortable job, succeeding on luck and tenacity. Usually she gets her man. This time she gets a monkey. She also gets a big guy named Diesel. Diesel pops in and out of Plum’s life like birthday cake – delicious to look at and taste, not especially healthy as a steady diet, gone by the end of the week if not sooner. He’s an über bounty hunter with special skills when it comes to tracking men and pleasing women. He’s after Grimoire, and now he’s also after Munch. And if truth were told, he wouldn’t mind setting Stephanie Plum in his crosshairs. Diesel and Plum hunt down Munch and Grimoire, following them into the Barrens, surviving cranberry bogs, the Jersey Devil, a hair-raising experience, sand in their underwear, and, of course . . . monkeys.</p>"

At the heart of the book is ""The Save Yourself Plan"" - a streamlined, five-month countdown that delivers genuine long-term financial security.

392,THREE CUPS OF TEA,"['Greg Mortenson', 'David Oliver Relin']",9780142414125,"<p><P>This young readers' edition of the worldwide bestseller <i>Three Cups of Tea</i> has been specially adapted and updated by Greg Mortenson to bring his remarkable story of humanitarianism up-to-date. It includes brand-new photos, maps, and illustrations, as well as a special afterword by Greg's twelve-year-old daughter, Amira, who has traveled with her father as an advocate for the Pennies for Peace program for children.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Some failures lead to phenomenal successes, and this American nurse's unsuccessful attempt to climb K2, the world's second tallest mountain, is one of them. Dangerously ill when he finished his climb in 1993, Mortenson was sheltered for seven weeks by the small Pakistani village of Korphe; in return, he promised to build the impoverished town's first school, a project that grew into the Central Asia Institute, which has since constructed more than 50 schools across rural Pakistan and Afghanistan. Coauthor Relin recounts Mortenson's efforts in fascinating detail, presenting compelling portraits of the village elders, con artists, philanthropists, mujahideen, Taliban officials, ambitious school girls and upright Muslims Mortenson met along the way. As the book moves into the post-9/11 world, Mortenson and Relin argue that the United States must fight Islamic extremism in the region through collaborative efforts to alleviate poverty and improve access to education, especially for girls. Captivating and suspenseful, with engrossing accounts of both hostilities and unlikely friendships, this book will win many readers' hearts. (Mar.) Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.</p>"
