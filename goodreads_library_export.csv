It wasn't too dark (Pretty Girls by Karin Slaughter was very good but it nearly turned me away from this genre because it was so graphic) and there was just enough suggestion to let the reader assume what happened. This book was perfectly paced until the end :(( I felt the ending was a bit rushed especially with the reveal of what happened to Delilah. I think some of it was a bit far fetched like the cop lying about the dna test like that was terrible and Bea managing to keep a child in her garage for 11 years without anyone noticing. ,true,,1,0
